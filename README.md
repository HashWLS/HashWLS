The datasets and source code of #WLS are for Simple and Efficient Hash Kernels for Graphs with Continuous Attributes.

The steps of running the experiments:

Preparation work

    1. compile svmtrain in libsvm-matlab by referring to libsvm-matlab/matlab/README
    2. put the mex file in the same directory as 'main.m'

Graph classification

    run main.m
    
All the results are generated under the directory, 'results/'

Parameter Sensitivity

    run draw_parameters.m
